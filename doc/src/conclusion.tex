The flexibility of multiple supernodes feature can be enhanced by adding other parameters to be included in the load balancing evaluation. When initiating a community, an edge may expand its set of potential supernodes if response times are under a configurable limit and choose them in a random way. Improving edge-nodes discovery and communication by using distributed hash tables (\emph{DHT}s) may cancel out the need for supernodes and would enable full decentralization.
